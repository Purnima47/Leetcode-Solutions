## Description üìë

#### A robot on an infinite XY-plane starts at point `(0, 0)` facing north. The robot can receive a sequence of these three possible types of `commands`:

- `-2`: Turn left `90` degrees.

- `-1`: Turn right `90` degrees.

- `1 <= k <= 9`: Move forward `k` units, one unit at a time.

#### Some of the grid squares are `obstacles`. The `ith` obstacle is at grid point `obstacles[i] = (xi, yi)`. If the robot runs into an obstacle, then it will instead stay in its current location and move on to the next command.

#### Return the maximum Euclidean distance that the robot ever gets from the origin squared (i.e. if the distance is `5`, return `25`)

#### Note:

- North means +Y direction.

- East means +X direction.

- South means -Y direction.

- West means -X direction.

- There can be obstacle in [0,0].

## **EXAMPLES**üí´‚ú® </br>

<h3>

<ins>**Example 1**:</ins> </br>


| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `commands = [4,-1,3]`, `obstacles = []` | `25` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

The robot starts at (0, 0):

1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).

2. Turn right.

3. Move east 3 units to (3, 4).

The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (3, 4), which squared is 32 + 42 = 25 units away.

<h3>

<ins>**Example 2**:</ins> </br>

| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `commands = [4,-1,4,-2,4]`, `obstacles = [[2,4]]` | `65` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

The robot starts at (0, 0):

1. Move north 4 units to (0, 4).

2. Turn right.

3. Move east 1 unit and get blocked by the obstacle at (2, 4), robot is at (1, 4).

4. Turn left.

5. Move north 4 units to (1, 8).

The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (1, 8), which squared is 12 + 82 = 65 units away.

<h3>

<ins>**Example 3**:</ins> </br>

| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `commands = [6,-1,-1,6]`, `obstacles = []` | `36` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

The robot starts at (0, 0):

1. Move north 6 units to (0, 6).

2. Turn right.

3. Turn right.

4. Move south 6 units to (0, 0).

The furthest point the robot ever gets from the origin is (0, 6), which squared is 62 = 36 units away.

## Constraints üîç
