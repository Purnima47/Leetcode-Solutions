## Description üìë

#### There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `fromi` and `toi`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

#### Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is at most `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

#### Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities `i` and `j` is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

<ins>**Example 1**:</ins> </br>

![1334_find_the_city_01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a09bfca-ccca-40dc-a779-22f650cccc02)


| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1]`,`[1,3,4],[2,3,1]]`, `distanceThreshold = 4` | `3` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.
