</h2>


## Description üìë

#### You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1` (inclusive).

#### You are also given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from `fromi` to `toi` in the graph.

#### Return a list `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the list of ancestors of the `ith` node, sorted in ascending order.

#### A node u is an ancestor of another node `v` if `u` can reach `v` via a set of edges.
