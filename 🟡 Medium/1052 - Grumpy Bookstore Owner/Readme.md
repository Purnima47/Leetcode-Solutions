## Description üìë

#### There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for `n` minutes. Every minute, some number of customers enter the store. You are given an integer array `customers` of length `n` where `customers[i]` is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the `ith` minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute

#### On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where `grumpy[i]` is `1` if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the `ith` minute, and is `0` otherwise

#### When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied

#### The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for `minutes` consecutive minutes, but can only use it once

#### _Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day._
