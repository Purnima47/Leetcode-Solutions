## **EXAMPLES**üí´‚ú® </br>

<h3>

<ins>**Example 1**:</ins> </br>


| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"]`, `words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]` | `2` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.

- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.

- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.

- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.

Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

<h3>

<ins>**Example 2**:</ins> </br>

| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"]`, `words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]` | `0` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.

<h3>

<ins>**Example 3**:</ins> </br>

| _INPUTS_ | _OUTPUT_ |
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| `words1 = ["a","ab"]`, `words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]` | `1` |

</h3>

<h3>
<ins>Explanation:</ins>
</h3>

The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".
