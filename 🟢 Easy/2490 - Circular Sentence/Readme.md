## Description üìë

#### A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.

- For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences.


#### Words consist of only uppercase and lowercase English letters. Uppercase and lowercase English letters are considered different.


#### A sentence is circular if:

- The last character of a word is equal to the first character of the next word.

- The last character of the last word is equal to the first character of the first word.


#### For example, `"leetcode exercises sound delightful"`, `"eetcode"`, `"leetcode eats soul"` are all circular sentences. However, `"Leetcode is cool"`, `"happy Leetcode"`, `"Leetcode"` and `"I like Leetcode"` are not circular sentences.

#### Given a string `sentence`, return `true` if it is circular. Otherwise, return `false`.
